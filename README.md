# Introduction to Machine Learning for chemists

Machine Learning, a subdomain of Artificial intelligence, is a pervasive technology that would mold how chemists interact with data. Therefore, it is a relevant skill to incorporate into the toolbox of any chemistry students. Here we present a course that introduces machine learning for chemistry students based on a set of Python Notebooks and assignments. Python language, one of the most popular programming languages, allows for free software and resources, which ensures availability. The course is constructed for students without previous experience in programming, leading to an incremental progression in depth and complexity that covers both programming and machine learning concepts. The examples used are related to real data from physicochemical characterizations of wines, producing an attractive material that captures the interest of students.

Topics included are:
* **Introduction to Python**
* **Basic Statistics**
* **Data Visualization and Dimension Reduction**
* **Classification**
* **Regression**
